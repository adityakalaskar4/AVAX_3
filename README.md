# Avax_3
## Introduction
In this project, I will create a smart contract on the Avalanche (Avax) blockchain, focusing mainly on the implementation of important management-related tasks. Respect the value of the token. The contract supports operations such as minting, burning and sending tokens to different locations. They have special responsibilities for distribution, production and conservation.

## Project Overview
1. Blockchain: Avalanche (Avax)
2. *Main function:*
- *Mint:* Mint Coins of the specified value.
- *Burn:* Reduced usage token.
- *Transfer:* Seamless transfer of tokens.

## Implementation of the method
The structure of the contract ensures the security and control of the token business:
- *Mint:* Minting tokens reduces the initial price while increasing the additional cost.
- *Burning:* Token burning reduces the balance, essentially eliminating the minting process. This feature has proven to be very useful in token exchange.
= *Transfer:* Transfer token to the specific address by specific amount.

## Execution workflow
To use a smart contract, the following steps must be performed:
1. Compilation: Use a template to write a smart contract. 
2. *Delivery:* Send the contract to the desired address.
3. Token Mint: Make more money than you want.
4. Token Burn: Reduce the token supply by burning tokens commonly used for trading.
5. Token Transfer: Cause damage by sending tokens to other addresses.
6. Certificate: Check the balance after several transactions to ensure authenticity.
